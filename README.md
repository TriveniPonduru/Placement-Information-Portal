The Placement Information Portal is a web-based application designed to simplify and streamline the campus placement process for students, faculty, and placement officers. It acts as a centralized platform where students can easily access real-time updates about company drives, job roles, interview questions, selected seniors, and study materials.

The portal provides role-based access â€” allowing admins to securely manage company data, results, and learning resources, while students and faculty have structured access to relevant information.

This project is developed using:

React.js for a fast, responsive, and user-friendly frontend.

Spring Boot for a robust backend with secure API communication.

MySQL for efficient storage and retrieval of student, company, and placement data.

The goal is to improve transparency, communication, and preparation support for students, while ensuring smooth and secure operations for the placement cell.
